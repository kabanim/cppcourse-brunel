### INTRODUCTION

This project aims to simulate A neural network. 
The network consists of 12500 neurons, of which 20% are inhibitory and 80% are excitatory. The probability of a connection from one neuron to another is 10%. In addition, all neurons are connected to background neurons outside the network, which act as excitatory neurons from inside the network. 
The "background noise" generated by these is simulated by a Poisson distribution of parameter the external frequency vext per time step of the simulation.

### BUILDING

Place yourself in the build-dir3 directory and execute the following commands in the terminal:

		cmake ..
		make

### SIMULATION TIME

This simulation takes quite a long time up to 5 minutes so please wait until the simulation ends
To test different graphs output, change two things in the constants file:
                1. the v ext constant to 2 , 0.9 or 3 dependant on the graph you want to see and firing rate of the neurons
		2. the strength of connections g 6, 5, 4.5 or 3
Then you can place yourself in the build-dir3 and exceute the following commands to create the graphs

   	       python3 graphes.py


### Results graphs
A folder with the results graphs was created for each of the Brunel figures in figure 8, A, B, C and D page 197


### RUNNING THE SIMULATION

To run the simulation, execute the generated excecutable by copying the following command in the terminal
                ./simulation

### RUNNING TESTS

Place yourself in the build directory and execute the following commands in the terminal:

		cmake ..
		make
		make test
		
This generates an executable, NeuronSimulation_test, which can be launched for further information. Make tests indicates whether the test passed.
